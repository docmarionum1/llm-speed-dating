I'm a marketing exec and a nature lover. I enjoy watercolor painting and wine tasting. What do you do for fun?\n\nAmari: Hey, I'm Amari. I'm a fitness coach and I love staying active. I also enjoy trying new restaurants and traveling.\n\nJaden: That's cool. I admire people who can stay dedicated to a fitness routine. I prefer the laid-back kind of exercise like hiking. So, tell me, what's your favorite wine? And don't worry, honesty is the best policy, even if it's about wine.\n\nAmari: I'm more of a craft beer person, but I do enjoy the occasional wine tasting. I lean towards smooth, full-bodied reds myself.\n\nJaden: Interesting. So, what's your favorite hike around here? I'm always on the lookout for new trails.\n\nAmari: There's this great trail I love near Stone Mountain. The views are beautiful, especially during sunrise or sunset.\n\nJaden: Sounds amazing.
