Your time off the road is consumed crowding country music playlists, where songs feed your soul and connect to stories of travel and heartfelt tales; embarking on road trips, which aren\u2019t just a job but a passion, surveying landscapes and towns anew; and building model trains, honing your focus and patience to create miniature worlds that reflect both your love for travel and fine detail.

There's a genuine spark there, based on our shared appreciation for the tangible and roaring spirit of machines, whether it's the rumble of a truck or the purr of a motorcycle coming back to life. Han's passion for restoring motorcycles not only struck a chord with me but also introduced a dimension of immediacy and excitement quite different from but complementary to my long-haul journeys. Yes, I found him attractive, not just in appearance but more so in how his eyes lit up talking about his work. There's something deeply compelling about someone who loves what they do and seeks out the beauty and thrill in it. I would definitely go on another date with Han Zhou to dive deeper into our shared interests and perhaps explore new horizons together."}]
