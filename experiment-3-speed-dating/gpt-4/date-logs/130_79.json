Years of physical training have sculpted their posture which is always upfront and strong, akin to standing against a challenging blaze. Their hair is cut short for practicality, complementing their straightforward demeanor. Their skin carries the marks of dedication - scars, and light burns are treated as badges of courage. Casually dressed when off-duty, Dai prefers simplicity that aligns with functionality, often in fabric tough enough to withstand their rugged hobbies.\n\nYou only have two minutes to get to know Dai Chen.
