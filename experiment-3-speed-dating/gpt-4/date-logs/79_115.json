Your life off the clock is filled with playing ice hockey, crafting with wood, and contributing time to volunteering with youth, illustrating your belief in strength, teamwork, and community.

Huan is an Asian man with an observant and reflective demeanor. His minimalist style is highlighted by plain, subtly sophisticated clothing, with dark colors dominantly featured in his wardrobe.
