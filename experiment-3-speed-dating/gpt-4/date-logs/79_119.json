Your life off the clock is filled with playing ice hockey, crafting with wood, and contributing time to volunteering with youth, illustrating your belief in strength, teamwork, and community.

Adrian\u2019s hair, kept in a practical style that requires little maintenance, and their unassuming air, belie the innovative strategies and complex beats pulsating through their head.\n\nYou only have two minutes to get to know Adrian Fernandez.
